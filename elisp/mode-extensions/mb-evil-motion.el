;;; transpose sexp, lift sexp, raise sexp

;;; expand-insert (a general evil command): This is insertion from
;;; normal mode using some kind of smart expansion mechanism.

;;; in lisp mode, toggle sexp keymap with s (or key chord ss) 
;;; Note these Emacs functions: goto-first-sexp

;;; Much of the clue is the variable evil-cross-lines. This should be
;;; set to t before applying the normal sexp movements. Maybe it
;;; should be set to t in the sexp mode alltogether.

"Not sure if I should define a certain state. Perhaps it is
better to keep it within Normal state and offer a
toggle-sexp-minor-mode method, or something. The toggle and
retoggle should be a nullimpotent operation.

Needs, then, to
 switch some keymaps
 define, undefine some text objects?
 change tag
 else?
