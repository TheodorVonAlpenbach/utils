SET PITCH CLASS
one of 0..11 where 
0  represents all pitch classes enharmonic to C,
1  represents all pitch classes enharmonic to C#
...
11 represents all pitch classes enharmonic to B

SET INTERVAL
the distance between two set pitch classes modulo 12

SET CHORD
a chord consisting of set pitch classes (instead of pitch classes)

(set chord) SKELETON
given a set chord, sc, the /skeleton/ of sc is a list of the distinct
set intervals from sc's root to sc's set pitch classes. A skeleton is
usually ordered and non-trivial. 

TRIVIAL skeleton
A skeleton where the first trivial set interval (0) is included.

ORDERED skeleton
A sorted skeleton (least set interval first).

skeleton Nth INVERSION
The resulting skeleton of the NTH inversion of the chord corresponding
to the original skeleton.
