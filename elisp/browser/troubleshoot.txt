2 Crash
=======

If there are more than two lynx jobs at the same time, something has
gone wrong with the jobs stack. Probably one job is hanging, and a
user request forces lynx to pop another job off the stack.

This is not good even if it should not necessarily lead to error.
However, a safer approach is to tag each job with a state mark, e.g.
«in progress», «in queue», «finished». In case of hanging processes, a
timestamp could be provided as well. (How about two parameters both
nil at job create. The the first is set to start time of lynx
processing, the other still being nil. When the processed is finished,
the second is also timestamped.)
