! defines _intermap_ (to distinguish from ordinary (key-)map).
  Intermap signifies "interactive map", ie. emacs starts some
  graphical browser (currently internet explorer, arrgh) which
  displays some map corresponding to some arguments given via emacs.
! defines _district_: some subset of the earth's surface. ('Region' is
  perhaps better, but this term causes confusion with the homonymous
  emacs-term.)
* find a db containing places on earth, or just use mapquest (somehow)
o introduced intermap.el (interactive maps)
* string-to-intermap

o handles one more entry style in ls. 2000-09-05: ok
o remove last empty line in ectaco dictionaries. 2000-09-05: ok. NB,
  the problem was that I got error with regexp "\n\n", while the true
  string was "\n[spaces or tabs]\n[spaces or tabs]". I think I've had
  this problem before as well, but I've forgotten where. Well, some
  time I'll find out.
o reverse order of summary. 2000-09-05: ok.

2000-08-21
o add nice feature, "see 'word'", where word is in proxy. This is
  useful when a word does not exist in the dictionary (usually because
  the word is not a lexem.) 2000-09-05: ok, instead of a prepending
  "see ", I appended a " <==".

* clean up the lookup interactives (there is only one necessary). Use
  nice defaults!

2000-08-17
* remove the lynx references from lsmorph.

2000-08-16
o add url-enconding (lynx-stuff) for Norweigian letters. 2000-08-16:
  ok.

2000-08-09
o an additional date entry for last lookup (used with proxy). This is
  important in order to summarize lately looked up words from the
  proxy. ok, 2000-08-11
x in the summary buffer, print more meta info: the dic, the dates etc
  for each entry. ok, 2000-08-11, but can be better. 2000-09-05: made
  the separation string look nicer, with the lookup word centered on
  it. NB, the centering technique using REPLACE!

2000-08-02
o lookup proxy C-c d p 2000-08-02: ok, I also provided a nice little
  feature: the cursor is moved to the end of the word found near
  point. This should be the default in my opinion. Also, as mentioned
  in the doc string, since this interactive macro is used several
  places and is 2/3 of the whole function, it is convenient to write a
  macro for this.
* introduce *dic-fail-filters*, an assoc list of (dic regexp), where
  REGEXP is to be compared to the lookup string in DIC. If there is a
  match, the lookup is regarded as failed (eg. "could not find an
  entry...").
* the lookup proxy interactive completion should only show the ok
  entries. Use *dic-fail-filters* to this end.

2000-08-01
x (dic-info &optional (dic *dic-current*) &key time-extension): 
  prints number of entries, entries sorted, number of failed enties
  (using regexp-string for each dic) ==> C-c d C-i.

2000-07-28
o add query feature 'dic-show-lookups 2000-07-28: ok. In order to do
  this, I also implemented a time library (mb-utils-time). Very nice
  implemented, actually, considered being the first try.

2000-07-26
o when entries are not found in mw, the suggestions are shown instead.
* show lookup entry in mode line (use local variable mode-line-format)

o include entry in help buffer title line
o proxy for all dictionaries
o legge inn http://www.ectaco.com/online/diction.php3?lang=6

2000-07-18
* the different dictionaries must be separated in the proxy
* it should be possible to edit the entries
o add date entry 2000-07-28: ok, but not checked
* sort the entires from
  http://www.ectaco.com/online/diction.php3?lang=6
* there's a lot of "no matches found". These lookup entries could be
  treated separately.
o the minibuffer should behave the as when changing dictionary. Easy.
  2000-07-18: not so easy, but an instructive excercise
o ignore case -> convert to lower case? 2000-07-28: ok w -> (downcase
  w), both for lookup and deletion
o there is now one buffer for each lookup. Should be only one for each
  dictionary? 2000-07-26: Changed back to one buffer for each
  dictionary only.
o the dic-lookup-interactive should provide the dictionary name in
  prompt (first try failed). 2000-08-17: ok. Also, the minibuffer
  handling has become much more elegant by using completion from
  proxy.
